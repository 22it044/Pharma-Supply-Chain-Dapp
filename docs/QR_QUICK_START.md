# QR Code Integration - Quick Start Guide

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. QR Code Generation
- **File**: `client/src/Track.js`
- **Feature**: Automatic QR code generation for each medicine
- **Location**: Track page displays QR code alongside medicine details

### 2. QR Code Scanner
- **File**: `client/src/QRScanner.js` (NEW)
- **Feature**: Full-featured QR scanner with status update capability
- **Route**: `/qrscanner`

### 3. Navigation
- **File**: `client/src/Components/Navbar.js`
- **Feature**: Added "ðŸ“· QR Scanner" link in navigation bar

### 4. Routing
- **File**: `client/src/App.js`
- **Feature**: Added route for QR Scanner component

## ðŸš€ How to Test

### Step 1: Ensure Prerequisites
```bash
# Make sure Ganache is running (or your blockchain network)
# Make sure MetaMask is connected to the correct network
```

### Step 2: Start the Application
The application is already running at http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Set Up Test Data
1. **Register Roles** (if not done):
   - Go to "Register Roles"
   - Add RMS, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer

2. **Add Medicine**:
   - Go to "Order Medicines"
   - Add a test medicine (e.g., "Aspirin", "Pain relief medication")

### Step 4: Test QR Generation
1. Navigate to **Track** page
2. Enter the medicine ID (probably "1" if it's your first medicine)
3. Click "Track"
4. âœ… **Verify**: QR code appears on the right side of medicine info

### Step 5: Test QR Scanning
1. Navigate to **ðŸ“· QR Scanner** from navbar
2. Click "Start Scanner"
3. **Option A - Scan from screen**:
   - Use your mobile device
   - Open camera and point at the QR code on your computer screen
   - OR use a second monitor/device
   
4. **Option B - Test with printed QR**:
   - Take a screenshot of the QR code
   - Print it
   - Scan with your device camera

5. **After scanning**:
   - Medicine details should load automatically
   - Select an action from dropdown (e.g., "Raw Material Supply")
   - Click "Update Status"
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - âœ… **Verify**: Status updates successfully

### Step 6: Verify Status Update
1. Go back to **Track** page
2. Enter the same medicine ID
3. âœ… **Verify**: Stage has changed to the new status

## ðŸ“± Testing Without Physical Device

If you don't have a second device, you can still test:

1. **Use Browser DevTools**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
   - Set to mobile view
   - Open QR Scanner in this view

2. **Manual Input Testing**:
   - Instead of scanning, you can modify the code temporarily to accept manual ID input
   - Or use the Supply page to update status (original method)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features to Verify

### QR Code Generation (Track.js)
- [ ] QR code displays when tracking a medicine
- [ ] QR code is scannable
- [ ] QR code encodes the correct medicine ID

### QR Scanner (QRScanner.js)
- [ ] Camera activates when clicking "Start Scanner"
- [ ] Scanner detects QR code automatically
- [ ] Medicine details load after scanning
- [ ] Dropdown shows all stage options
- [ ] Status update transaction works
- [ ] Success/error messages display correctly
- [ ] Can scan multiple QR codes in sequence

### Integration
- [ ] Navigation link appears in navbar
- [ ] Route works correctly
- [ ] All blockchain interactions function properly
- [ ] MetaMask prompts for transaction approval
- [ ] Status updates persist on blockchain

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Camera Not Working
**Solution**: 
- Ensure browser has camera permissions
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for camera access)
- Check if another app is using the camera

### Issue: QR Code Not Scanning
**Solution**:
- Improve lighting
- Hold camera steady
- Adjust distance from QR code
- Ensure QR code is clearly visible

### Issue: Transaction Failing
**Solution**:
- Check MetaMask is connected
- Verify account is registered for the role
- Ensure account is active
- Check medicine is in correct stage
- Verify sufficient gas in wallet

### Issue: "Smart contract not deployed"
**Solution**:
- Ensure Ganache is running
- Verify contract is deployed: `truffle migrate --reset`
- Check network ID matches in MetaMask

## ðŸ“Š Complete Workflow Test

### End-to-End Test Scenario:
1. **Setup** (Owner account):
   - Register all roles (RMS, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer)
   - Add a medicine (ID: 1)

2. **Stage 1 - RMS** (Switch to RMS account in MetaMask):
   - Go to QR Scanner
   - Scan medicine QR code
   - Select "Raw Material Supply"
   - Update status
   - Verify stage = "Raw Material Supply Stage"

3. **Stage 2 - Manufacturing** (Switch to Manufacturer account):
   - Scan QR code
   - Select "Manufacturing"
   - Update status
   - Verify stage = "Manufacturing Stage"

4. **Stage 3 - Distribution** (Switch to Distributor account):
   - Scan QR code
   - Select "Distribution"
   - Update status
   - Verify stage = "Distribution Stage"

5. **Stage 4 - Retail** (Switch to Retailer account):
   - Scan QR code
   - Select "Retail"
   - Update status
   - Verify stage = "Retail Stage"

6. **Stage 5 - Sold** (Retailer account):
   - Scan QR code
   - Select "Mark as Sold"
   - Update status
   - Verify stage = "Medicine Sold"

## ðŸ“¦ Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `client/src/QRScanner.js` - QR scanner component
- `QR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `QR_QUICK_START.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `client/src/Track.js` - Added QR code generation
- `client/src/App.js` - Added QR scanner route
- `client/src/Components/Navbar.js` - Added navigation link
- `client/package.json` - Added dependencies (qrcode.react, html5-qrcode)

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

Your QR integration is working correctly if:
1. âœ… QR codes generate and display on Track page
2. âœ… QR scanner activates camera successfully
3. âœ… Scanning QR code loads medicine details
4. âœ… Status updates work through QR scanner
5. âœ… Blockchain transactions complete successfully
6. âœ… Changes persist and are visible in Track page
7. âœ… Navigation works smoothly between pages

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Once testing is complete:
1. Deploy to testnet for remote testing
2. Test with multiple users/devices simultaneously
3. Add additional features:
   - Batch QR generation
   - QR code download/print
   - Scan history
   - Advanced error handling
4. Optimize for production deployment
