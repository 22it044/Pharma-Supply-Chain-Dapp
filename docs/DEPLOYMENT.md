## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+ and npm/yarn
- Truffle Suite (`npm install -g truffle`)
- Ganache (for local blockchain) or access to Ethereum testnet
- MetaMask browser extension

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Pharma-Supply-Chain-Dapp-main
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# Install smart contract dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
```

3. **Configure Truffle**
Edit `truffle-config.js` if needed for your network setup.

4. **Start Ganache**
- Open Ganache UI and create a new workspace, OR
- Run Ganache CLI: `ganache-cli`

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
```bash
# From root directory
truffle compile
truffle migrate --reset
```

6. **Configure MetaMask**
- Add Ganache network to MetaMask
- Import accounts using Ganache mnemonics
- Ensure you have test ETH in your accounts

7. **Start the Application**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files if needed for production deployment:

```env
REACT_APP_INFURA_KEY=your_infura_key
REACT_APP_NETWORK=mainnet|rinkeby|goerli
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

For testnet/mainnet deployment:

1. Update `truffle-config.js` with network configuration
2. Add your wallet mnemonic securely (use environment variables)
3. Get test ETH from faucets (for testnets)
4. Deploy: `truffle migrate --network <network_name>`

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Never commit private keys or mnemonics
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement proper access controls in smart contracts
- [ ] Conduct security audit before mainnet deployment
- [ ] Test thoroughly on testnets first
- [ ] Implement emergency stop mechanisms
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Use secure RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on frontend
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
